# Solving Boggle

While the code is original and all my own, the idea is not. I saw a video onces of code solving the online boggle game, word twist, but I could not find the source code. So I deicded to recreate it myself.

I first used a linear system to search through the dictionary and decide if it was a word but then I made my own Trie data structure.
